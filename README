Quantum Toys

Hi, this github repository contains a tutorial on building your own
simulation of a quantum computer right on your PC. So, I will assume
from now on that you are curious about that! :) It was designed and
written by Javier Rodríguez-Laguna (UNED, Spain), specially for a
seminar at the Computer Science School, UCM, Madrid.

First, download and read the PDF document, tutorial.pdf.

Second, download and compile the accompanying code. You will need to
have a Linux box (or to be smart enough to tweak around it). Also, you
will need some basic libraries, like BLAS, LAPACK, Xlib and Imlib for
optimal performance. For example, in Ubuntu, you should do

sudo apt-get install libblas-dev libblas3 liblapack-dev liblapack3 libX11-dev libImlib2-dev

make xqview

./xqview

Then, relax and enjoy.

Have fun!
